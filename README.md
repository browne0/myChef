# myChef 

[myChef](http://dev.beesdesign.net/mychef) is a simple application that could find local chefs in the nearby area. The backend for the website was never finished because the client backed out, but it was a still a beautiful website.

## Getting Started

In order to run this site, you will need a database set up. I recommend download Wampserver, and setting up a database and changing the names of the tables/names as you see fit.

You won't be able to run the site without a server/ server environment, since all of the files are in PHP.
